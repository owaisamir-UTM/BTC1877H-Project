Orange - patient demographic data
Green - underlying respiratory diagnosis + important intraoperative descriptions (first lung transplant vs repeat, use of ExVIVO perfusion, whether the patient was on ECLS/ECMO prior to transplant)
Red – preoperative bloodwork (hemoglobin, platelets, coagulation parameters)
Teal - ECMO/No ECMO (whether patient’s transplant was performed with ECMO support or not). The second column highlighted includes Cardiopulmonary Bypass, which is an infrequently used and more complex form of ECLS and it is known to be associated with more bleeding.
Yellow - blood product transfusion data.
Blue - survival and ICU LOS data.
